## Overview

Apollo Flight Trader (Route Manager) is a flight price monitoring and booking optimization tool. It enables last-minute travel by prebooking commonly taken flights at flex/main levels, allowing for spontaneous trips and upgrades while reducing airport planning overhead.

### Key Features
- Low latency flight price monitoring with historical and volatility analysis
- Route management for tracking common flight routes and pricing
- Direct integration with Amadeus Flight API
- Planned: Booking, rescheduling, and buying agent

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS, Radix UI |
| Charts | Recharts, Chart.js |
| Backend | Netlify Functions (serverless) |
| API | Amadeus Flight API |
| Deployment | Netlify, GitHub Actions |

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (frontend + Netlify functions)
npm run dev:clean

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run tests
npm test
npm run test:watch

# Linting
npm run lint

# Deploy to Netlify
npm run deploy

```

## Architecture Patterns

### Frontend
- **Component Structure**: Functional components with hooks
- **State Management**: React useState/useEffect (no Redux)

### Backend (Netlify Functions)
- **Pattern**: Serverless functions with CORS middleware
- **API Integration**: Amadeus SDK for flight data

### Deployment
- **Environments**: Alpha (development), Gamma (staging), and Prod (protected)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with config-driven environment selection
- **Configuration**: Edit `deployment-config.json` to change target environment
- **CDK**: Optional AWS CDK infrastructure in `/cdk` directory
- **Secrets**: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NETLIFY_SITE_ID_GAMMA`, `NETLIFY_SITE_ID_PROD`
- **Alpha Site ID**: `b26b3133-30c1-46f3-b976-59ab7c928b57` (hardcoded)

## Authentication

Currently no user authentication implemented. Amadeus API credentials are stored as environment variables in Netlify:
- `AMADEUS_API_KEY`
- `AMADEUS_API_SECRET`
- `AMADEUS_HOSTNAME`

## Backlog

Project backlog: https://github.com/users/IamJasonBian/projects/1

## Environments

| Environment | URL | Site ID |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| Alpha | https://route-manager-alpha.netlify.app/ | b26b3133-30c1-46f3-b976-59ab7c928b57 |
| Gamma | https://route-manager-gamma.netlify.app/ | (GitHub secret) |
| Prod | https://route-manager-prod.netlify.app/ | (GitHub secret) |

## Changing Deployment Target

To deploy to a different environment:
1. Edit `deployment-config.json` in the root directory
2. Change `targetEnvironment` to `"alpha"`, `"gamma"`, or `"prod"`
3. Submit a PR with the change
4. Once merged, the workflow will deploy to the specified environment

Alternatively, use the manual workflow dispatch in GitHub Actions to deploy to any environment on-demand.
