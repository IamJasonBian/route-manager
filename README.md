## Features

- **Price Analysis** - Monitor flight prices with 4-month forecasting and price + volatitity curves. Understand the efficient frontier of transfers and 1 stop + nonstop routes across multiples nodes into one outbound node. Analyze all good destinations from a single flight node.
- **Same-day books** - Find flights where prices don't significantly change over time (shuttle routes) and opportunistic day of drops and bookings
- **Push Alerts** - Get notified about price drops and good day of bookings
